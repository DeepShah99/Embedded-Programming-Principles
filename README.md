# Embedded-Programming-Principles
I closely worked on STM32 to design and develop embedded projects which covered software design and implementation using the C language. Topics included: algorithm design, modular code design, programming style, functions, arrays, pointers, strings, data structures, and input/output. Emphasis was placed on using these techniques for embedded software development, including the use of embedded development tools.
